### Proposed question: Can we model competition between specialist and generalist bees on pollen resource?

#### Things I want to incorporate in the model

      1) Generalist bees are polylectic, and therefore are able to utilize multiple flower types for pollen extraction
      2) Specialist bees are monolectic, and therefore will only be able to utilize a singular flower type for pollen extraction
      3) Generalist will be more "clumsy" at pollen extraction, meaning that per time step, they extract less pollen then their specialist competitors.
