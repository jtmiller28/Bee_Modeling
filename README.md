# Bee_Modeling
My EEMB 194CA/595CA Mathematical Models for Bees. This project focuses on on looking at the competition between specialist and generalist bees on native and non-native plant species pollen as the resource. The model will also assess the benefit for each plant, and quantify its long term effects on the system.
